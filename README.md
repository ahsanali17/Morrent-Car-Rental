Built With
Car Rent is built with modern web technologies, TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript, CSS Modules for modular and reusable CSS, and React Context API for managing application state. It also integrates with external platforms like Stripe for payment processing, and MongoDB for data storage. Finally, Google OAuth2 and Passport.js is used to handle user authentication and authorization:

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that allows developers to add type annotations to their code, providing additional type checking and improved code readability. TypeScript can be used with a variety of different JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
Styled Components Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!
Stripe is a platform for building and managing online payment systems. It provides APIs for integrating with a variety of payment methods, including credit cards, bank transfers, and digital wallets.
Express is a web application framework for Node.js that provides a simple and flexible way to build web applications and APIs. It includes a range of features for routing, middleware, and error handling.
MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like documents. It is designed for flexibility and scalability, making it a popular choice for modern web applications.
Google OAuth 2.0 Google OAuth 2.0 allows users to share specific data with an application while keeping their usernames, passwords, and other information private.
Passport.js Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application.
